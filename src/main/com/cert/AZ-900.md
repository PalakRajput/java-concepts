#### Cloud computing

Delivery model for services like:
networking, storage(files/db), compute power(os/web), analytics, etc. over the internet.

##### Characteristics of cloud

1. Scalability: Ability of the resource to scale(add/remove resources)
   Types: Vertical(Increasing size of resources), Horizontal(Increasing the amount of resources).
2. Elasticity: Ability of the system to scale dynamically.
3. Agility: In general it is the ability to react quickly. In terms of cloud computing it is the ability to allocate and
   deallocate resources quickly.
4. Fault Tolerance: Ability of the system to remain up and running during component or service failure.
5. Disaster recovery: Ability of the system to recover from a disaster(human made or natural).
6. High Availability: Ability of the system to run for very extended period of time with very little downtime.

##### Economies of scale

As the company grows the price per unit will decrease.
As the cloud grows and has more customers than price will go down.

##### CapEx vs OpEx

1. Capital Expenditure: Own infrastructure, big initial investment to purchase infra upfront, maintenance required.
2. Operation Expenditure: No initial investment, pay for rented infra, no or minimal maintenance.

##### Consumption based pricing model characteristics

1. No upfront cost.
2. No wasted resources.
3. Pay for only those resources that you use.

##### Cloud service type

Infrastructure layer: Networking, storage, virtualization, servers
Platform layer: OS, middleware, runtime(docker, iis)
Software layer: Application & data

1. Infrastructure as a service(IaaS): Cloud provider manages infra, customer manages platform and software.
   Use cases: Migration of workloads(lift and shift from on-prem to cloud), Test & development, Storage, backups and
   recovery.
   Example: Virtual machines, Virtual network, Managed disk.
2. Platform as a service(PaaS): Cloud provider manages infra as well as platform and customer manages software.
   Use cases: Development framework, Analytics & business intelligence
   Example: SQL, function apps, logic apps, app service, etc
3. Software as a service(SaaS):
   Use cases: Buying licence/subscription of the applications.
   Example: OneDrive, Outlook, Teams, Skype, etc

##### Cloud Deployment type

1. Public cloud: All the resources are hosted on cloud, no local hardware, some service share hardware bw different
   customers so there can be issue with security & compliance and with ownership as the cloud providers own all
   resources.
2. Private cloud: Everything runs on our own data center, and we manage all the hardware.
3. Hybrid cloud: Combines both public and private cloud.

#### Core architectural components of Azure

1. **Azure Data Center:** Physical facility for hosting group of networked servers. It has its own power, cooling and
   networking infrastructure.
2. **Azure Regions:** Group of data centers that are connected with each other. They are globally distributed. Region is
   a
   geographical area on the planet which at least contains 1 but usually more data centers connected with low latency
   networks(optical fibre). This is the location for our services. Some services are available only in certain regions.
   Some services are not deployed in specific region.
3. **Availability zone:** Each availability zone is a physically separate data center within a region, with independent
   power, cooling, and networking infrastructure. Azure has at least 3 availability zones in a region but some regions
   doesn't support availability zones.
   **Zonal service:** We can choose which availability zone we are deploying the services to, but we are responsible for
   fail over. Used in IaaS.
   **Zone redundant:** The data is automatically available in different zones and the replication and fail over is
   maintained by Microsoft. Used in PaaS.
4. **Region Pairs:** They are at least 300 miles away from each other in order to lower the impact of region failure.
   Each pair resides within same geography exception is Brazil south.
5. **Geography:** Typically contains two or more regions. They are fault-tolerant to protect from region wide failures.
   They ensure compliance requirements are met. Ex: Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, etc.
6. **Azure Resources:** Objects used to manage services in azure. Any configuration on service are properties of
   resource and any resource can be represented as a JSON template. A resource cannot exist without resource group and
   each resource can be present in any one resource group at a time.
7. **Resource Group:** Group of resources. The resources can be grouped by type, app lifecycle(dev/prod), department
   name, billing, location, etc. Resource groups cannot be nested.
8. **Subscription:** A subscription trust only 1 Azure AD tenant. Budget, RBAC, policies can be applied to a
   subscription. The rules applied to a subscription is inherited by the resource groups inside the subscription and
   resources inside resource groups.
9. **Management Groups:** To manage multiple subscriptions. We can apply RBAC, policies, budgets to management groups
   which will be inherited by the subscriptions -> resource groups -> resources.
10. **Azure Resource Manager(ARM):** Deployment and management service for creating, updating, deleting resources. All
    the requests(be it portal, cli, rest api, sdk) for managing a resource goes to resource manager where the customer
    is authenticated and upon successful authentication the request is forwarded to the respective service to create the
    actual resources. Resource groups comes under resource manager.
11. **ARM Bicep:** Human friendly language to create resources, it is Infrastructure as Code(IaC). The bicep code is
    transpiled to JSON ARM template.
12. **Azure Capacity Resource(ARC):** It acts as a bridge that extends the azure platform to our environments(hosted
    outside of azure).

#### Azure compute and networking services

1. **Virtual Machines:** Resources required for VM are: Operating system disk, data storage, virtual network(subnet),
   virtual network interface card, public ip, network security group(NSG)
2. **VM Scale Set:** Build on top of VM. A template is specified which contains type of OS, config properties, and
   scale(min, max, auto). 
3. **Azure Container Instance:** For deploying a single container.
4. **Azure Kubernetes Services(AKS):** For container orchestration.
5. **Azure App Service:**
